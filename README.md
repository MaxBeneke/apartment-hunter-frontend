# Apartment//Hunter
Apartment//Hunter is an apartment listing application in the same vein as Zillow or StreetEasy. Users can sign-in, search a list of apartments by ZIP code, and sort/filter those results with parameters like price, number of bathrooms, minimum square footage, etc. There's also a Google Maps integration that allows for users to see their listings appear on the map. They can also favorite their listings for later viewing.
